# Johnsion Noise Measurement

This project involves measuring Johnson Noise in electronic devices. The project duration is from September 2023 to January 2024, as part of my experimental course: PHYS 309 at UBC.

In this course, I measured the noise signals of resistors with different resistances and at various temperatures. The experimental data was then curve-fitted to the hypothesis model proposed by Dr. John B. Johnson.
